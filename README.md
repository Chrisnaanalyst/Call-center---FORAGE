# Call Center Analysis

![](customer_care.jpg)

## Introduction: 
 This Power BI project on Call center Analysis. The dataset contains the Call Id, Agent, Date, Time, Topic, Answered (Y/N), Resolved, Speed of answer in seconds, AvgTalkDuration and Satisfaction rating.

## Content:
_The dataset contains the following fields:_
- Call Id: The identification number for received calls.
- Agent: The names of agents handling the calls.
- Date: The date when the calls were received.
- Time: The time when the calls were made.
- Topic: The issue addressed during the calls.
- Answered (Y/N): Indicates if the call was answered (Y for Yes, N for No).
- Resolved: Indicates if the call was resolved (Y for Yes, N for No).
- Speed of Answer in Seconds: The time interval at which the call was answered.
- AvgTalkDuration: The average time spent on calls.
- Satisfaction Rating: The satisfaction rating given by customers to the agents.

# Skills/ concepts demonstrated:
## The following Power BI features were incorporated:
Data cleaning,  Data Abstraction, DAX, Modelling, slicers.
### Data cleaning: 
1. I changed the data types to the correct and appropriate data types.
2. I change the column with answered Y/N to  Y = Yes and N = No for better and easy understanding
3. I did the same thing to resolved column Y to Yes  and N to No.

### Data Abstraction: 
I added another column by extracting the day name and day of weeks from the date column.

### DAX: 
I Created an empty table called measure table using this formular Measure Table = GENERATESERIES(1,1) This table is to hold all the measures I am going to be creating to avoid by work been jampad together. The following are the measures I created:
1. Average Customer Satisfaction = AVERAGE('Call Center'[Satisfaction rating])
2. Average Handle Time = AVERAGE('Call Center'[AvgTalkDuration])
3. Average Speed of Answer = AVERAGE('Call Center'[Speed of answer in seconds])
4. Number of calls abandoned = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Call Center'), 'Call Center'[Answered (Y/N)]="N")
5. Number of calls answered = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Call Center'),'Call Center'[Answered (Y/N)] = "Y")
6. Total Calls Not Resolved = COUNTROWS(FILTER('Call Center', 'Call Center'[Resolved] = "N"))
7. Total Calls Resolved = COUNTROWS(FILTER('Call Center', 'Call Center'[Resolved] = "Y"))
8. Average Talk Duration (Minutes) = [Average Talk Duration (Seconds)] / 60
9. Average Talk Duration (Seconds) = AVERAGE('Call Center'[TotalSeconds])
10. Count of Calls = COUNT('Call Center'[Call Id])

# Problem statement:
1. Overall customer satisfaction
2. Overall calls answered/abandoned
3. Calls by time
4. Average speed of answer
5. Agent‚Äôs performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered.


_And I also created a calculated columns by adding a new column in the modelling tab. Theses are the formular below:_
1. Hour = HOUR('Call Center'[Time])
2. TotalSeconds = (HOUR('Call Center'[AvgTalkDuration]) * 3600) +(MINUTE('Call Center'[AvgTalkDuration]) * 60) +
SECOND('Call Center'[AvgTalkDuration]).

# Modelling:
There is only one table with a measure table i created in order to helps to structure my data model efficiently, providing clear, organized, and optimized calculations for analysis.
The model is a Fact Table with Measures Model.

# Insights
1. Average Customer Satisfaction by Agent:
‚Ä¢	Insight: The average customer satisfaction scores are relatively close, with the highest being 3.5 and the lowest 3.3. Most agents have a score of 3.4.
‚Ä¢	Recommendation: Focus on small improvements in customer interactions to raise the overall satisfaction scores. Consider training sessions or workshops to share best practices among agents, especially those scoring 3.5.
2. Top Satisfaction Rating:
‚Ä¢	Insight: The highest satisfaction rating category is "Satisfied" at 23.6%, followed by "Neutral." "Very Dissatisfied" is the least common rating.
‚Ä¢	Recommendation: Analyze the factors contributing to the "Satisfied" and "Neutral" ratings to replicate successful strategies. Address the issues leading to "Dissatisfied" and "Very Dissatisfied" ratings through targeted feedback and process improvements.
3. Total Calls by Day:
‚Ä¢	Insight: Saturday has the highest call volume, followed by Monday, with Friday having the least number of calls.
‚Ä¢	Recommendation: Schedule more agents to work on Saturdays and Mondays to handle the higher call volumes. Consider offering incentives for agents willing to work on weekends.
4. Number of Calls Answered by Month:
‚Ä¢	Insight: January has the highest number of answered calls at 1,772, followed by February at 1,616, and March at 1,612. January accounts for 35.44% of the total answered calls.
‚Ä¢	Recommendation: Investigate the reasons for the high call volume in January and adjust staffing levels accordingly. Ensure adequate staffing in other months to maintain high service levels.

# General Recommendations
1.	Staff Training and Development:
o	Conduct regular training sessions focused on improving customer satisfaction. Use the insights from high-performing agents to guide these sessions.
o	Provide personalized coaching to agents with lower satisfaction scores to help them improve.
2.	Customer Feedback Analysis:
o	Regularly review customer feedback to identify common issues and areas for improvement. Implement changes based on this feedback to enhance customer satisfaction.
3.	Resource Allocation:
o	Adjust staffing schedules based on call volume trends. Ensure that more agents are available during peak times, such as weekends and the beginning of the year.
o	Consider flexible staffing solutions, like part-time or temporary workers, to manage fluctuations in call volume.
4.	Incentive Programs:
o	Implement incentive programs to reward agents who achieve high customer satisfaction scores and handle a high volume of calls effectively.
